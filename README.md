# Machine-Learning
This repository explores Machine Learning (ML), covering fundamental concepts, algorithms, and hands-on projects. It includes supervised and unsupervised learning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and optimization techniques. Using frameworks like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, I document my learning journey and real-world applications.
